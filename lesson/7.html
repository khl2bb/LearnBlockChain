  <p>Nice work!</p>
  <p>You can add emphasis to link texts, if you like. In the box below, make the
  phrase "really, really" bold, and have the entire sentence link to www.dailykitten.com.
  You'll want to make sure that the bold phrasing occurs within the link text brackets.</p>

  <p>Fantastic!</p>
  <p>Although it might make for an awkward experience, you can make links within
  headings, too.</p>
  <p>For this next tutorial, make the text a heading four, and turn the phrase
  "the BBC" into a link to www.bbc.com/news:</p>

  <p>That's all there is to writing inline links.</p>
  <p>The other link type is called a <em>reference</em> link. As the name implies,
    the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an example of what
    we mean:</p>
  <pre>
     Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com
  </pre>
  <p>The "references" above are the second set of brackets: <code>[another place]</code> and
    <code>[another-link]</code>. At the bottom of a Markdown document, these brackets are defined
    as proper links to outside websites. An advantage of the reference link style
    is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once. For
    example, if we decide to make all of the <code>[another place]</code> links go somewhere
    else, we only have to change the single reference link.</p>
  <p>Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. You define them by providing
    the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, followed by the link.</p>
  <p>In the box below, we've started writing out some reference links. You'll
    need to finish them up! Call the first reference tag "a fun place", and make
    it link to www.zombo.com; make the second link out to www.stumbleupon.com.</p>
